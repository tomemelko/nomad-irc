nomad-irc
=========

A IRC chatbot named nomad. A little pet project in python.

Why?
====

When you have no friends, you make your own.

How to use him
==============

Well right now the two pkl (python pickle module) files that come with the python script store the data in the srctxt/ folder. If will add new files to the database, but you have to delete the pkl files to add them as of right now.

Config can be found at the top of nomad.py.

Personality
===========

His personality is based on the source material you feed him, if the stuff you feed him is vulgar, then he will be vulgar.

With the currently loaded files he is a movie-quoting potty mouth.
